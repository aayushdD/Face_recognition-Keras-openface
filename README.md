# face_recognition
This repository contains codes for face recognition. The ideas for this repository are the results of a complete study of another fellow github contributor 
iwantooxxoox/Keras-OpenFace and the original Facenet model.
I have studied the original model and the repository from iwantooxxoox/Keras-OpenFace and combining the ideas has led to this mini project


The notebooks contains the notebook version of the codes which have been compiled.
the weights folder contains all the weights for the layers of the model

the utils script contains the utilities for the software the verify script contains the code for the comparison and a way to add new data to the database for 
personal testing of the model

the applicaion is the main script which is the real implementation of all the scripts written before .
