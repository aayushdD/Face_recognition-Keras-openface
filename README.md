# face_recognition
This repository contains codes for face recognition. The ideas for this repository are the results of a complete study of another fellow github contributor 
iwantooxxoox/Keras-OpenFace and the original Facenet model.
I have studied the original model and the repository from iwantooxxoox/Keras-OpenFace and combining the ideas has led to this mini project
